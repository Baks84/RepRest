mega-sdk
========

This is an initial release for Mega API for .NET used in the Mega Desktop client.

Note: in .NET, to enable more than 2 concurrent HTTP connection, you need to set the property
System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit to e.g. 8. You need to do this once in your Main method or similar.

The code is GPLv3 licensed; we are also considering MIT or LGPL release - feel free to contact team@megadesktop.com
